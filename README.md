# customize_terminal
Reading your terminal commands sometimes very difficult and difficult to differentiate. 
Colorizing certain commands  can save times and and it's more productive. 
I saved  ".file" as "terminal", so,  they won't be hidden. 
But, in terminal create with
```sh
$ touch .bashExtension
$ Atom .bashExtension
```
with these bash extensions  and paste these codes; the results you will see in terminal after restarting :)
